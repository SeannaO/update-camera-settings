  "readme": "# react-draggable [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mzabriskie/react-draggable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mzabriskie/react-draggable)\n\nA simple component for making elements draggable.\n\n[View the Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Demo\n\n[View Demo](http://mzabriskie.github.io/react-draggable/example/)\n\n\n## Installing\n\n```bash\n$ npm install react-draggable\n```\n\nIf you aren't using browserify/webpack, a\n[UMD version of react-draggable](dist/react-draggable.js) is available. It is updated per-release only.\n\nIf you want a UMD version of the latest `master` revision, you can generate it yourself from master by cloning this\nrepository and running `$ make`. This will create umd dist files in the `dist/` folder.\n\n## Details\n\nA `<Draggable>` element wraps an existing element and extends it with new event handlers and styles.\nIt does not create a wrapper element in the DOM.\n\nDraggable items are moved using CSS Transforms. This allows items to be dragged regardless of their current\npositioning (relative, absolute, or static). Elements can also be moved between drags without incident.\n\nIf the item you are dragging already has a CSS Transform applied, it will be overwritten by `<Draggable>`. Use\nan intermediate wrapper (`<Draggable><span>...</span></Draggable>`) in this case.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\n/** @jsx React.DOM */\nvar React = require('react'),\n\tDraggable = require('react-draggable');\n\nvar App = React.createClass({\n\thandleStart: function (event, ui) {\n\t\tconsole.log('Event: ', event);\n\t\tconsole.log('Position: ', ui.position);\n\t},\n\n\thandleDrag: function (event, ui) {\n\t\tconsole.log('Event: ', event);\n        console.log('Position: ', ui.position);\n\t},\n\n\thandleStop: function (event, ui) {\n\t\tconsole.log('Event: ', event);\n        console.log('Position: ', ui.position);\n\t},\n\n\trender: function () {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t// <Draggable/> transparently adds draggable interactivity\n\t\t\t// to whatever element is supplied as `this.props.children`.\n\t\t\t// Only a single element is allowed or an Error will be thrown.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// The element is moved from its current position using absolute positioning.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `axis` determines which axis the draggable can move.\n\t\t\t// - 'both' allows movement horizontally and vertically (default).\n\t\t\t// - 'x' limits movement to horizontal axis.\n\t\t\t// - 'y' limits movement to vertical axis.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `handle` specifies a selector to be used as the handle that initiates drag.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `cancel` specifies a selector to be used to prevent drag initialization.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `grid` specifies the x and y that dragging should snap to.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `bounds` specifies movement boundaries. Pass:\n\t\t\t// - 'parent' restricts movement within the node's offsetParent\n\t\t\t//\t (nearest node with position relative or absolute), or\n\t\t\t// - An object with left, top, right, and bottom properties. These indicate how far in each direction\n\t\t\t//   the draggable can be moved. See example/index.html for more on this.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `start` specifies the x and y that the dragged item should start at. This is generally not necessary\n\t\t\t//   to use (you can use absolute or relative positioning of the child directly), but can be helpful\n\t\t\t//   for uniformity in your callbacks and with css transforms.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `moveOnStartChange`, if true (default false), will move the element if there is a change in `start`.\n\t\t\t//   We set this by default to `false` because it can cause unwanted effects if you are not aware of it.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `zIndex` specifies the zIndex to use while dragging.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `onStart` is called when dragging starts.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `onDrag` is called while dragging.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// `onStop` is called when dragging stops.\n\n\t\t\t<Draggable\n\t\t\t\taxis=\"x\"\n\t\t\t\thandle=\".handle\"\n\t\t\t\tstart={{x: 0, y: 0}}\n\t\t\t\tmoveOnStartChange={false}\n\t\t\t\tgrid={[25, 25]}\n\t\t\t\tzIndex={100}\n\t\t\t\tonStart={this.handleStart}\n\t\t\t\tonDrag={this.handleDrag}\n\t\t\t\tonStop={this.handleStop}>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"handle\">Drag from here</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>Lorem ipsum...</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</Draggable>\n\t\t);\n\t}\n});\n\nReact.renderComponent(<App/>, document.body);\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n- Fork the project\n- Run the project in development mode: `$ make dev`\n- Make changes.\n- Add appropriate tests\n- `$ make test`\n- If tests don't pass, make them pass.\n- Update README with appropriate docs.\n- Commit and PR\n\n## Release checklist\n\n- Update CHANGELOG\n- `make release-patch`, `make release-minor`, or `make-release-major`\n- `make publish`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
