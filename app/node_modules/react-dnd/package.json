Support for touch events is on the roadmap but not currently implemented.\n\n>If your company uses React DnD and would like to speed up its development, consider sponsoring the project. I'm currently doing it in the spare time but I would be happy to work on it part-time. Drop me an email at <a href='mailto:dan.abramov@me.com'>dan.abramov@me.com</a>. Exciting new features take time.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n* Keep user in full control over rendering;\n* Don't make assumptions about consuming components and their structure;\n* Hide underlying implementation and its quirks;\n* Make 80% easy, 20% possible.\n\nYou can also read **[The Future of Drag and Drop APIs](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/the-future-of-drag-and-drop-apis-249dfea7a15f)** to get an idea of where we're heading.\n\n\n## Live Demo\n\n#### [See it in action!](http://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/) ([Source](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/tree/master/examples))\n\nDemo contains a variety of things you can implement with this library, including:\n\n* Reacting to hover and dropping;\n* Dropping files;\n* Dragging a box around with snapping;\n* Drawing a custom drag layer;\n* Making cards sortable.\n\nYou can do much more, but these examples will help you get started!\n\n## Features\n\n* Emits zero DOM or CSS of its own;\n* Like original HTML5 API, emphasizes dragging data and not just “draggable views”;\n* Support dropping files using the same API;\n* Lets components register as “drag sources” or “drop targets” for different kinds of data;\n* Lets a single component contain several drag sources and drop targets;\n* Lets you provide a custom drag handle, whether DOM subnode or an image;\n* Takes the best from HTML5 API but [hides its many quirks](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html):\n  - doesn't require you to `preventDefault` anything to start working;\n  - emits `enter` and `leave` as you'd expect instead of doing it for every child node;\n  - lets you read drag state from `render()`;\n  - consistently fires events even if source DOM node was removed;\n* Includes a helper to preload images for drag thumbnails;\n* Lets you render a custom drag layer if you'd rather draw your own drag preview.\n\n## Documentation\n\n### SemVer\n\nWe plan to follow SemVer after 1.0. Before 1.0, minor version bumps may contain breaking changes. Breaking changes will be documented in the **[Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/blob/master/docs/UPGRADE_GUIDE.md)**.\n\n### API Reference\n\nComplete API reference is available **[here](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/tree/master/docs/API.md)**.\n\n### Walkthrough\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable diving into examples source code just yet, you can start with **[the walkthrough](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/tree/master/docs/Walkthrough.md)**.\n\n### Examples\n\nHave you played with **[live demo](http://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/)** yet? Here's **[the source code for it](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/tree/master/examples)**.\n\nTo try it locally, clone the project and run:\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm start\nopen http://localhost:8080/\n```\n\nExamples use **[ES6 syntax](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/)** via **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)** transpiler. You can still use React DnD in an ES5 codebase, but if you copy code from examples, make sure you translate it to ES5 where needed.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe library can be used separately (`dist/ReactDND.min.js`) or with a bundler such as Webpack or Browserify.\n\n```\nnpm install --save react-dnd\n```\n\n## Future Roadmap\n\n* Touch support;\n* Support for mouse events instead of HTML5 drag-and-drop events;\n* Dragging multiple items at once.\n\n## Production Usage\n\n* [Stampsy](http://stampsy.com), where it was originally developed, is using React DnD for the post editor.\n* [Add your company!](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/edit/master/README.md)\n\n## See Also\n\n* [react-draggable](https://github.com/mzabriskie/react-draggable) by [Matt Zabriskie](https://github.com/mzabriskie)\n* [react-sortable](https://github.com/danielstocks/react-sortable) by [Daniel Stocks](https://github.com/danielstocks)\n* [react-dropzone](https://github.com/paramaggarwal/react-dropzone) by [Param Aggarwal](https://github.com/paramaggarwal)\n\n## Thanks\n\nThis library is a React port of an API, parts of which were originally written by [Andrew Kuznetsov](http://github.com/cavinsmith/).\n\nA lot of recent progress is due to [Nathan Hutchison](https://github.com/nelix)'s contributions and effort.\n",
